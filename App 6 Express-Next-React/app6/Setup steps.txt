initialize a basic directory and package.json file
> npm init

for installing packages
> npm install react react-dom next

create following directories and files
/pages
    /index.js
/components
    /Header.js
    /Footer.js
    /Layout.js  
    etc

to run with next instead of node, add scripts in package.json
scripts : {
    "dev": "next",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
}
and run with "npm run dev" i.e. "npm next"
it seeks index.js in /pages directory as entry point.

                Starting a Express Server instead of next's
> npm install express --save

add file 'app-server.js' in root folder and write code for server to run just like in express
but while handling requests  don't do it manually in express, instead use next's handle function,
so now next will route pages to client.

to run the app use 'node' instead of 'next' now.
> node app-server

in server file, you can also define your own routes other than /pages routes of next.
it will help you calling backend from frontend. i.e. api calls. models & controllers and api code will be hidden from frontend.
routes will provide only endpoint i.e. requests and responses from express.
